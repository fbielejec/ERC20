# ERC20 Implementation Challenge

Test yourself by implementing erc20 token from memory, from scratch. See if it passes the rigorous test suite!

## Getting Started

1. Implement your ERC20 token in `src/ERC20.sol`
2. Run the test suite to validate your implementation:
   ```bash
   forge test
   ```

## Test Suite

The repository includes comprehensive tests covering:
- Basic ERC20 functionality (transfer, approve, transferFrom)
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Fuzz testing with random inputs
- Invariant testing to ensure token supply consistency

Good luck!
